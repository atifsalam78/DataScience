8/8/23, 5:01 PM - +92 333 3786116: ChatGPT:

I apologize for the oversight. The code you provided is correct, and there is no obvious reason for the "TypeError: 'str' object is not callable" error.

The error you encountered is usually due to accidentally using the same variable name as a built-in function. However, in the code you've shared, there's no evidence of any variable name conflict.

To diagnose the issue further, please check if there are any other parts of your code where you might have inadvertently used the same variable name as a built-in function. Also, ensure that there are no indentation or syntax errors in your code.

If you are still encountering the error and need further assistance, please share the full code so that I can help you better.

**Python String Concatenation and Formatting Assignments**

**Assignment 1: String Concatenation and Formatting**

**Instructions:**

1. Create a variable `name` and assign your name to it.
2. Create a variable `age` and assign your age to it.
3. Create a variable `country` and assign your country of residence to it.
4. Using the `+` operator, concatenate the variables to form a sentence in the following format: "My name is `<name>`, I am `<age>` years old, and I live in `<country>`."
5. Print the concatenated sentence.

**Assignment 2: String Formatting using `.format()`

**Instructions:**

1. Create a variable `item` and assign a product name to it (e.g., "laptop", "book", "phone").
2. Create a variable `price` and assign a price to the item.
3. Create a variable `quantity` and assign a quantity value.
4. Calculate the total cost using the formula: `total_cost = price * quantity`.
5. Using the `.format()` method, create a formatted string: "I bought `<quantity>` `<item>`(s) at `<price>` each, for a total of $`<total_cost>`."
6. Print the formatted string.

**Assignment 3: String Interpolation using `f''`

**Instructions:**

1. Create a variable `city` and assign the name of a city.
2. Create a variable `temperature` and assign a temperature value in Celsius.
3. Using `f''` string interpolation, create a string: "The temperature in `<city>` is `<temperature>`°C."
4. Print the interpolated string.

**Assignment 4: String Formatting using `%()`

**Instructions:**

1. Create a variable `first_name` and assign your first name to it.
2. Create a variable `last_name` and assign your last name to it.
3. Create a variable `birth_year` and assign your birth year.
4. Calculate your age using the formula: `age = current_year - birth_year`, where `current_year` is the current year.
5. Using `%()` string formatting, create a string: "My name is %(first_name)s %(last_name)s. I am %(age)d years old."
6. Print the formatted string.

**Assignment 5: Combining Formatting Methods**

**Instructions:**

1. Create a variable `product` and assign a product name.
2. Create a variable `discount` and assign a discount percentage.
3. Create a variable `original_price` and assign an original price.
4. Calculate the discounted price using the formula: `discounted_price = original_price * (1 - discount / 100)`.
5. Using any combination of string formatting methods (`+`, `.format()`, `f''`, `%()`), create a descriptive string with the product name, original price, discount percentage, and discounted price.
6. Print the descriptive string.

8/24/23, 4:08 PM - Azim NED PGD: any one here who explain me this code, 

strings = ["abcsub-033_ses-01_mod-mri", "defsub-044_ses-01_mod-mri", "ghisub-055_ses-02_mod-ctscan"]
regex = re.compile("(sub-[^_]+)") 
print([regex.sub("SUB-", s) for s in strings])
regex.sub("SUB-", "toto")
8/24/23, 4:16 PM - Azim NED PGD: my query is 
1. first start with re.compile where mention in group (sub-[^_]+)
explanation: its means search the result from text where sub-033 and other elements will be remove.
2. using regex.sub("SUB-",s) for s in string
explanation: its mean in s at 0 index first elements like "abcsub-033_sec-01_mod-mri"
system what will do that sub- replace into SUB- and abc could be same in result -033 would be same except "_"
but in result 033 is remove and _ is avaliable why ?
8/24/23, 4:16 PM - Azim NED PGD: any one help me on this code
8/24/23, 4:17 PM - Azim NED PGD: result is : ['abcSUB-_ses-01_mod-mri', 'defSUB-_ses-01_mod-mri', 'ghiSUB-_ses-02_mod-ctscan']

Such scheduling during uncommitted hours in the form of extra classes is highly inconvenient, and destroys the entire purpose of being a part of a program for oneself. Please understand.

8/27/23, 8:25 PM - +92 331 2311120: Ive heard today @923152968211 will give a project based assignment in which he recommended to form a team and do it. So teams sir khd banaenge ya we have to chose our own? Correct me If I am wrong please
8/27/23, 8:31 PM - +92 345 8205010: He will not make any teams.

According to him

1. Everyone has to submit project individually
2. Everyone can share her/his research/findings with every one <This message was edited>
8/27/23, 8:33 PM - +92 315 3956321: Sir allowed us to do project with group or individuals but every one have to submit on its own
8/27/23, 8:34 PM - +92 331 2311120: Oh alrighty there. Thank you
8/27/23, 8:34 PM - +92 345 8205010: and if i remember correctly, all will have to provide/mention the sources/links/urls used for research
8/27/23, 8:47 PM - +92 314 2767501: Yes kindly share with all
8/27/23, 8:49 PM - +92 345 8205010: Does anyone remember what is the project ?

If yes, please share the details in steps/pointers.

Thanks.

8/27/23, 9:07 PM - +92 315 8956255: 100 Percent. Right.
8/27/23, 9:07 PM - +92 301 4656137: *The project in place of the mid-term exam is to create a Python class that will convert any language into Urdu using APIs, as our teacher demonstrated in class today.*
8/27/23, 9:08 PM - +92 315 8956255: No demonstrate to much. But orally explain
8/27/23, 9:10 PM - +92 345 8205010: Thank you!

Which part is to be done in *Flask*?
8/27/23, 9:11 PM - +92 345 8205010: And for which purpose we have to use *ChatGPT* ? <This message was edited>
8/27/23, 9:13 PM - +92 345 8205010: Is there any *API* we have to use? <This message was edited>
8/27/23, 9:19 PM - +92 347 2058120: API key ap generate karskte ho
8/27/23, 9:19 PM - +92 347 2058120: Or usko link karado
8/27/23, 9:20 PM - +92 347 2058120: Apne project se
8/27/23, 9:20 PM - +971 50 217 8363: First find the api endpoint
8/27/23, 9:20 PM - +971 50 217 8363: It's not easy to get I have tried the packages
8/27/23, 9:22 PM - +92 345 8205010: If any one can write down the steps involved in the project, it would be great.

I think many (including me) are confused what is the actual project, and the steps involved in it.
8/27/23, 9:22 PM - +92 347 2058120: OpenAi
8/27/23, 9:22 PM - +92 347 2058120: Generate API keys
8/27/23, 9:22 PM - +92 314 2767501: Yes
8/27/23, 9:23 PM - +92 305 3075434: It would be better. Those are confused who are not getting steps or don't know where to start.
8/27/23, 9:24 PM - +971 50 217 8363: What's open ai ?
8/27/23, 9:26 PM - +92 331 2311120: OpenAi is the company that created ChaptGPT and more in Deep Learning/AI side
8/27/23, 9:27 PM - +92 314 2767501: It create chatgpt
8/27/23, 9:27 PM - +92 331 2311120: Sir mera Mid term he lelen ap 😂
8/27/23, 9:27 PM - +92 314 2767501: And many Ai tools
8/27/23, 9:28 PM - +971 50 217 8363: Wait there is already a code on github and to use that code you have to use the libaray that are builin
8/27/23, 9:28 PM - +971 50 217 8363: Builtin
8/27/23, 9:28 PM - +92 314 2767501: Mid term m Kuch seekhny ko nhi milega dost ye project hmary liye filhaal naa mumkin hai mgr jb ye ban jaega tw apko khud interest hoga aagy sy aagy creation krny ka
8/27/23, 9:28 PM - +92 347 3742872: Yes same
8/27/23, 9:30 PM - +92 345 2377975: In a layman's terms, goto seamlessM4T (which the teacher showed in class) and replicate in your own similar web interfave, for this you will have the access of code and link via API.
Sir told that we need to get help from Quivr (for idea /concept) and subsequently use Flask for web development in python3.
8/27/23, 9:30 PM - +92 315 3956321: So hm Sb ko help krni chahye 
Jo bilkul is field say nahi ya new hay UN ka lyee
8/27/23, 9:30 PM - +92 345 2377975: *interface
8/27/23, 9:32 PM - +92 345 2377975: Once you know what is the ultimate Task to achieve then you should research for the tools required and discuss among the group members.
8/27/23, 9:32 PM - +92 314 2767501: Yes if anyone find better knowledge share it with all of us so everyone can do it possibly
8/27/23, 9:32 PM - +92 331 2311120: I agree 100% but at this point of stage its too early *for me* in particular to jump around advance tools such as Django and Flask. Wo ik alag study hy. 
Ab I’ll go with the majority and whatever Sir assigns but I personally think its too early to use Flask and Django. The goal is to learn and be 100% conceptually good rather copy pasting codes
I am talking about myself not others 😊 maybe yall are smarter 😉
8/27/23, 9:33 PM - +92 347 3742872: Good
8/27/23, 9:34 PM - +92 345 8205010: sab mil ker Sir se dubara request kertay hein k ab Mid-Term hi le lein .. project chhorein!!
8/27/23, 9:35 PM - +92 347 3742872: I think project okay rahega believe me this is a way to learn help hojaigi each other
8/27/23, 9:36 PM - +92 345 2377975: He is flexible in this regard, but for our betterment we should go for this project...many steps ahead 💪🏼
8/27/23, 9:36 PM - +92 331 2311120: Yes Project is fine but recommended to make our own project for what we have learnt till today. Rather playing around with Django anf Flask Frameworks
8/27/23, 9:36 PM - +92 347 3742872: Yes what I want
8/27/23, 9:36 PM - +92 345 8205010: I'm with you .. was just kidding in last message ;-)

I just want some clearly defined/written steps which we are supposed to perform.

I'm sure after investing a little time, we can do the project.
8/27/23, 9:37 PM - Azim NED PGD: Dear All just for help first draw your requirements on paper or draw structure on paper then design by prompt engineering
8/27/23, 9:37 PM - +92 347 3742872: Dear we are a team each other if someone knows how to create that project that one has to help use we can learn mor things like that
8/27/23, 9:38 PM - +92 347 3742872: Dear Azeem everyone is not aware of that including me 
So if you know how to make that so kindly share your pattern here as we can take help
8/27/23, 9:40 PM - +971 50 217 8363: Guys this is second step first  find the api that's the difficult part once you get the api then use chatgpt for the frontend code
8/27/23, 9:41 PM - +971 50 217 8363: For us like beginners it's not easy to use python packages because we haven't used it before
8/27/23, 9:41 PM - +92 333 6768741: Atleast you should try brother.
Most of us are same at this stage,and Sir Qasim also know that and ask us to try it.
Think out of box.
Great things never happened in comfort zone.
8/27/23, 9:41 PM - +92 347 3742872: Aqsa kindly share your knowledge here that which api should we need to find for connecting m4t with flask
8/27/23, 9:43 PM - +971 50 217 8363: Sure I am still stuck if I get something I will let you know I am stuck in using the fairseq libaray

8/27/23, 10:08 PM - +92 331 2311120: I am thinking right now. Will have to see what Best Ideas I can come across and how can I implement them till what I have learnt 😅
8/27/23, 10:10 PM - +92 305 3075434: No issues dud,. Cuz I have the idea which we can implement on websites.. it provides more efficiently or smoothly running websites to their client's.

8/28/23, 12:12 AM - +92 333 3786116: Dear Group Members,
We beginners/ new to this field are bit confused about the project like from where to start and how to start, where to use Python codes and how to integrate.
If we use the help of chatGPT, quiver we definitely reach there.
So I would recommend if we together arrange a meeting on Google meet and start from the scratch that will help everyone.
8/28/23, 12:12 AM - +92 347 2058120: Go the the command prompt
8/28/23, 12:12 AM - +92 347 2058120: And type
8/28/23, 12:13 AM - +92 347 2058120: Pip install flask

8/28/23, 12:34 AM - +92 300 8275267: Yes, you are right. We also want a group discussions on projects
8/28/23, 12:37 AM - +92 345 2935995: Agreed. It will help. And we need experts with us as well to join who have a coding background
8/28/23, 12:41 AM - +92 345 2935995: Most of us have to come out of our skin to complete this project because of no coding background and less time availability. As we are all professionals, not students anymore. It's difficult to manage time to research a lot.

Well I appreciate @923472058120 and @923343229688 they are doing something exceptionally and will help us out also

8/28/23, 11:35 PM - +92 332 2928615: Basically they are setting up quivr which was discussed by Sir Qasim
8/28/23, 11:36 PM - +92 332 2928615: I would recommend all the students having a cs background to form a different whatsapp group for their discussion so that others may not get confused
8/28/23, 11:37 PM - +92 315 3956321: What about other who dont have CS background
8/28/23, 11:37 PM - +92 332 2928615: Follow what is being taught in class
8/28/23, 11:37 PM - +92 332 2928615: You will eventually catch up with them
8/28/23, 11:39 PM - +92 315 2678929: Yes please. It’s very confusing for students like me with non IT background.

8/28/23, 11:41 PM - +92 332 2928615: But it involves installing other softwares as well

8/29/23, 12:42 AM - Azim NED PGD: Yes
8/29/23, 12:43 AM - +92 334 7386887: I believe a Vector Database. If I'm correct 🤔
8/29/23, 12:44 AM - Azim NED PGD: I don't know much detail just try to configure with the help of internet
8/29/23, 12:45 AM - +92 334 7386887: Oh ok, yes I think Supabase and ChromaDB are Vector Databases
8/29/23, 12:45 AM - +92 334 7386887: They are used to store embeddings that come from the Open AI api
8/29/23, 12:46 AM - Azim NED PGD: Jazakallaha for sharing
8/29/23, 12:47 AM - +92 303 2203507: Why dont we ask him to hold classes   this saturday sunday?
He is going quite fast 
Isnt? If i am not wrong
8/29/23, 12:50 AM - +92 334 7386887: But I think Sir is sharing some really latest technologies instead of repeating the old and boring stuff again and again. We should be thankful to him
8/29/23, 12:50 AM - +92 334 7386887: I agree with you that it's not easy to cope up, but trust me we'll thank him later.
8/29/23, 12:51 AM - +92 334 7386887: This extra efforts will help us get to know new technologies faster 🔥
8/29/23, 12:51 AM - +92 347 2058120: Right
8/29/23, 1:02 AM - +92 303 2203507: Yes thats correct

8/29/23, 4:50 AM - +92 334 2576742: There should have been training at Ned,s wet lab .
These are just dry lectures
8/29/23, 5:33 AM - +92 300 0770426: The problem is most of the people are already occupied in something else in their lives and we don't have much time to cover all at once. It's hard to get the pace of the class. Anyways that's why it's called post graduate diploma and we would need to get that pace. It requires our time and practice. We don't have any other option. It seemed easy to many of us but it's not. Still it's interesting.
8/29/23, 5:36 AM - +92 331 8467143: Agreed
8/29/23, 7:09 AM - +92 332 2526115: Same here 😥
8/29/23, 7:35 AM - +92 331 2311120: Much needed break to cover up

8/29/23, 11:25 AM - +92 345 2935995: Dear colleagues,

I think taking the gap will not work for us at all but it'll disrupt the pace of understanding Python concepts. I think we should ask Sir Qasim to further elaborate on the topics that some of us are still not clear about like RegEx, Def Function, and For & While Loops. I think many of us have some queries about these topics that need to be addressed and resolved. What's your take?
8/29/23, 11:25 AM - +92 345 2935995: Walaikum Asalam
8/29/23, 11:32 AM - +92 345 2935995: I'm trying to learn prompt engineering using ChatGPT or Bing but I'm unable to get the desired results. After watching several YouTube videos regarding prompt engineering, I reached the point that without having sound knowledge of programming languages like Python including its open-source libraries, we cannot prompt properly in any AI platform. It's like making a coffee without knowing its ingredients
8/29/23, 11:36 AM - +92 347 3742872: How are you working on project
8/29/23, 11:36 AM - +92 347 3742872: I have made this until in process not completed some kind of concussions I have
8/29/23, 11:36 AM - +92 347 3742872: <Media omitted>
8/29/23, 11:36 AM - +92 345 2935995: To get the desired results from an AI platform, we need to have a clear understanding of supervised machine learning
8/29/23, 11:37 AM - +92 345 2935995: Good Job 👍
8/29/23, 11:37 AM - +92 314 2767501: Assalam o Alaikum!
Koi bhai Jo expert hai wo Thora SA time Nikal saky agr Sath beth k Thora guide krdy  anyone?
8/29/23, 11:37 AM - +92 347 3742872: Actually we should have knowledge for the prompt engineering because whatever we are going to write in chatgpt that prompt all depend on us that  what we are asking before using prompt engineering we should have knowledge regarding the task
8/29/23, 11:38 AM - +92 347 3742872: We will inshallah we are here to help each other
8/29/23, 11:38 AM - +92 345 2935995: That's my point actually

8/29/23, 12:23 PM - +92 333 3786116: Good work 👍
8/29/23, 12:26 PM - +92 347 3742872: Agreed, but in my view which topics are not clear we should focus on because without practice these topics will never be in mind  so 1 thing we have to practice further after doing practice if we have any kind of problem then we can easily communicate with Sir Qasim

8/29/23, 4:50 PM - Azim NED PGD: Enabling virtualization in the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) is a common step when setting up virtual machines or using virtualization technologies like Intel VT-x or AMD-V. Here's a general guide on how to enable virtualization from the BIOS:

Please note that the exact steps and terminologies might vary based on your computer's manufacturer and BIOS version. These instructions are meant to provide a general guideline.

1. **Accessing BIOS/UEFI Settings:**
   - Restart or power on your computer.
   - During the boot-up process, you will typically see a message indicating which key to press to enter the BIOS or UEFI settings. This key can vary (common keys include F2, F10, Del, Esc, or others). Press the required key before the operating system starts loading.

2. **Navigating BIOS/UEFI:**
   - Once you're in the BIOS settings, use the keyboard arrow keys to navigate. The exact layout and options can differ among BIOS versions and manufacturers.

3. **Locating Virtualization Settings:**
   - Look for a section related to "Advanced," "Advanced Features," "Security," or "CPU Configuration." The virtualization settings might be located within these sections.
   - Look for options related to "Virtualization," "Intel VT-x," "AMD-V," or similar terms. The terminology can differ based on whether your system has an Intel or AMD processor.

4. **Enabling Virtualization:**
   - If the virtualization option is set to "Disabled" or "Off," use the keyboard arrow keys to select it.
   - Change the setting to "Enabled" or "On." This might involve pressing the "Enter" key or using specific function keys.

5. **Saving Changes:**
   - After enabling virtualization, navigate to the "Save & Exit" or similar section of the BIOS.
   - Choose the option to "Save Changes and Exit." This action will usually be confirmed with a "Yes" or "OK."

6. **Restarting:**
   - The computer will reboot with the changes applied.

Remember that making changes in the BIOS can affect the stability of your system, so be cautious while navigating and making modifications. If you're unsure about any specific settings or the process, consult your computer's user manual or the manufacturer's website for detailed instructions.

Once virtualization is enabled, you should be able to use virtualization technologies for running virtual machines and other related tasks. If you encounter any issues or unexpected behavior, you might need to update your BIOS or seek further assistance from the manufacturer's support resources.

A profiler that can be used to identify performance bottlenecks
A set of performance tuning recommendations
A set of performance monitoring tools
Quivr also provides a number of best practices for improving performance, such as:

Using caching to store frequently accessed data
Optimizing queries to reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed
Using a scalable database
By following these best practices, Quivr applications can be made to perform well even under heavy load.

8/31/23, 3:34 PM - +92 347 3742872: First of all, we need to understand the pathway for the following steps. However, at this point, we should focus on comprehending the steps from Step 1 to the last one. This will enable us to grasp how to execute the project and identify the sources from which we can obtain the required APIs. Additionally, we must acquaint ourselves with the reasons behind utilizing Docker, Supabase, and Quiver. Only after mastering these concepts can we truly progress towards achieving something substantial.

Moreover, it's essential to learn how to design the interface of a web application. These fundamental concepts should be crystal clear before delving into project work. Once these fundamentals are established, we can proceed to develop the interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. At that point, we must explore the technologies that allow us to leverage the capabilities of these programming languages, especially considering not everyone comes from an IT background.

9/1/23, 8:54 PM - Azim NED PGD: My expertise is in being a helpful, harmless, and honest AI assistant. I can provide relevant information by analyzing data from integrated apps like Slack, Notion, Facebook Ads, Google Docs, and GitHub. However, I do not actually take actions within those platforms - I can only read, summarize, and analyze data to have more informed conversations. My knowledge comes from connecting with real information sources, not the open internet. I aim to augment human workflows by providing tailored insights based on their actual content and data. However, I may sometimes generate incorrect or incomplete responses. My capabilities are designed to be useful while protecting privacy.

9/3/23, 12:08 AM - +92 303 2203507: Raaid, just a quick question
Why are you even taking this course if you are already pro  😀
9/3/23, 12:08 AM - +92 303 9123287: Thanks everyone
9/3/23, 12:10 AM - +92 303 9123287: I have no idea what Data Science/ML contains. Just have some experience of working with python as hobby.
9/3/23, 12:12 AM - +92 303 2203507: Thats correct
Keep learning
9/3/23, 12:14 AM - +92 331 2267022: MashaAllah Outstanding 👍🏻

9/3/23, 1:02 AM - +92 300 0770426: You did great brother. Not everyone is capable to do so in that short span of time. I wish we had mid terms instead of that project. I have been scratching my head. Just don't know where to start from.
9/3/23, 1:09 AM - +92 333 3786116: Brother the project is better than the exams... We are exploring, searching and finding the ways to explore the world and this is providing us research, knowledge and implementation experience and exams can only provide you experience of solving some queries.
9/3/23, 1:13 AM - +92 322 2218282: Very inspiring..
Amazing @923039123287 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
9/3/23, 1:20 AM - +92 300 0770426: You are right but it's not about giving the exams. It's about learning something step by step. We just jumped over something advance. It's our first semester and not everyone would be able to catch the same pace. It would just become some kind of race.
9/3/23, 1:22 AM - +92 303 9123287: Thanks everyone for appreciation.
9/3/23, 1:23 AM - +92 333 3786116: Brother, I'm also amongst them who haven't find the way out but I believe if others can do it, I can also do it 😉 Insha'Allah

9/10/23, 10:52 PM - +92 331 2499173: I did some work on it. Currently it is not possible that you can use seamleass translator model in windows machine local environment due to fairseq package as it is not available for windows. So you can only use the model in colab as it needs A100 machine. There is code available on github from facebook to setup on google colab. You can run the code there. <This message was edited>
9/10/23, 10:54 PM - +92 334 7386887: Yes, exactly
9/10/23, 10:54 PM - +92 334 7386887: I've trying whole day to find it's api to run it locally in my project
9/10/23, 10:54 PM - +92 334 7386887: But I failed to do so
9/10/23, 10:55 PM - +92 331 2499173: If you have macos or linux then might we can run it locally.
9/10/23, 10:55 PM - +971 50 217 8363: Than it's useless it will work as same any code run on colab . Yes there is a issue on fairseq libaray it will work on linus
9/10/23, 10:56 PM - +92 334 7386887: Yes, because fairesq2 is made for Linux only
9/10/23, 10:56 PM - +971 50 217 8363: Yes that's true
9/10/23, 10:56 PM - +971 50 217 8363: That's why I used the similar libaray
9/10/23, 10:56 PM - +971 50 217 8363: Google trans and gtts

9/10/23, 11:05 PM - +92 331 2499173: In my opinion it is a learning as well that how you can use different powerful models to your projects and how we can get benefit from the already pretrained models. Yes we can complete the project by google translation API but deploying m4t is also a good learning if we want to use different kind of models practically for the commercial projects if commercial usage license is there.
9/10/23, 11:06 PM - +92 334 7386887: Sure, I agree 👍

9/16/23, 3:07 PM - +92 300 0770426: You will have to make your own account. And then upload the files in your GitHub repository. And share the link
9/16/23, 3:11 PM - +92 333 6768741: I have my own account on GitHub and have created repository and uploaded a file.
Now when I am sharing the link on ned class room.it shows that page is blocked.

9/16/23, 7:31 PM - +92 305 3075434: Seniors plz.
9/16/23, 7:31 PM - +92 301 4656137: This is post graduate program
9/16/23, 7:32 PM - +92 305 3075434: Yes so is it enough or not?
9/16/23, 7:33 PM - +92 333 3786116: Bro, it's all about how you show case your work.... if you don't have degree but have an exception knowledge and hands on experience that would definitely help you. What I have experienced people mentioned in their resume that they know how to make rocket but when they go for interview they can't even explain.
9/16/23, 7:34 PM - +92 301 4656137: This message was deleted
9/16/23, 7:35 PM - +92 305 3075434: absolutely bro.. so I am just asking as a Pakistani how far we have to go through that we can make it.
9/16/23, 7:35 PM - +92 301 4656137: @923053075434 I think @923333786116 is right.
9/16/23, 7:37 PM - +92 333 3786116: Bro it's only upto you how you think that how far you can go... you have to work on it
9/16/23, 7:39 PM - +92 305 3075434: Ahm right.. but as I know it's not easy as a Pakistani to go abroad we have to work day and night.
9/16/23, 7:41 PM - +92 305 3075434: As per my knowledge there are a lot of seniors who are working online or doing freelance as they are not getting chance's to go outside the country.
9/16/23, 7:41 PM - +92 333 3786116: Exactly. Being a Pakistani we don't have a good image in the world... so only thing I would suggest to do some freelance work also upload on LinkedIn but before that wherever you want to move, add relevant people of that country and discuss your work with them.
9/16/23, 7:42 PM - +92 305 3075434: Good suggestions.🌸tnx
9/16/23, 7:44 PM - +92 333 3786116: Easiest way is, to move to gulf countries first because it's less costly and the experience we get there is considered genuine. Make some money then plan to move wherever you want.
9/16/23, 7:45 PM - +92 305 3075434: Hm right.

OPTION: Yes (41 votes)
OPTION: No (6 votes)

9/21/23, 12:35 AM - +92 303 2203507: Well i mistakenly read somewhere no exam of python due to project.
Otherwise i would have started practicing earlier.
9/21/23, 12:36 AM - +92 346 3042567: I was for the mid term exam. It's our final exam on Sunday.
9/21/23, 12:36 AM - +92 345 8205010: Dear Fellows

Regarding the project, can anyone help me understand the next step after creating a simple Flask app ?

9/21/23, 12:38 AM - +92 345 8205010: I've created a simple Flask app.

What's next ?

9/21/23, 12:47 AM - +92 334 3742954: But depends if authorities are all ears about it
9/21/23, 12:48 AM - +92 333 3138995: I think the more we delay,  the more we left behind to catch up with the other courses .
9/21/23, 12:48 AM - +92 341 2549838: Ned has announced the exam date for all PGD programs  :-/

As mentioned in the class paper will be similar to the assignment insha'allah
9/21/23, 12:54 AM - +92 333 3138995: I also got problem with flask and django so i just made the code
9/21/23, 12:54 AM - +92 314 2767501: @923343229688 bro according to time table last paper will be held on Friday 29th Sept may be management can shift our paper on Friday I'm not sure about Saturday Sunday may be they can adjust for us

9/21/23, 12:58 AM - +92 303 2203507: Correct
9/21/23, 1:00 AM - +92 333 3138995: Yes but i haven't used flask or django because i am a problem in it. 

But i have the main code which is running and for thr frame work i did with thinker.
9/21/23, 1:00 AM - +92 333 3138995: But there are people who have done with it you can use their code in ur code.
9/21/23, 1:01 AM - +92 333 3138995: Check in the project comments and read it thoroughly you will get an idea. Which of the code is missing and then improvised it. 

I can help u with the code but not with the frame work as i also dont know
9/21/23, 1:05 AM - Azim NED PGD: if we request to management that start our data visualization course from this Saturday Sunday but paper next Sat ya Sunday lelen ya Friday, this is suggestions from some one

9/21/23, 1:10 AM - +92 333 3786116: @923343229688 what good of extending the exam for 1 more week if ChatGPT would be allowed.

Well most of us don't have the clear idea/ concept about the codings we actually kept busy in completing the project by getting help from CHATGPT regardless of the concept/ logic.
9/21/23, 1:12 AM - +92 314 2767501: Sb soch k bethen hain Pura paper chatgpt sy krny ka😂

9/21/23, 7:17 PM - +92 305 3075434: No I give it there space,, but what the function of it when I am not putting the space it continues says error.. I need just concept of it

9/21/23, 7:20 PM - +92 347 2058120: I think 
I for i in list
Print I
9/21/23, 7:20 PM - +92 305 3075434: Not helpful,, I need just concept
9/21/23, 7:21 PM - +92 305 3075434: Exactly, but need to understand concepts why used I in print about three spaces Infront.
9/21/23, 7:24 PM - +92 335 1288220: I guess when we used we for loop, it automatically gives tab spaces before print.
9/21/23, 7:25 PM - +92 347 2058120: When ever you used : sign so next line must be in single tab space
9/21/23, 7:25 PM - +92 335 1288220: After ":", when u press enter, it automatically gives the tab spaces cuz it's in the 'for' block.
9/21/23, 7:26 PM - +92 305 3075434: It's not happening automatically we have to give instructions then it will work otherwise will be error .

However, if the project is outside of course outline, I would stick to the *Mid Term Exam*.

There are students who belong to entirely different background than IT or Software. If the project is out of the scope of course outline, it is injustice with the students coming from different background.

Support other ppls
9/25/23, 8:44 PM - +92 332 2928615: If the course is conducted on weekends physically, then the course instructor will change as Sir Qasim is not available onsite gor the weekends
9/25/23, 8:44 PM - +92 332 2928615: For alternate timings he may be available
9/25/23, 8:44 PM - +92 300 0770426: Exactly. We should think about everyone instead of our own feasibility
9/25/23, 8:45 PM - +92 332 2928615: We have no problem in bothe options
9/25/23, 8:45 PM - +92 332 2928615: *both
9/25/23, 8:48 PM - +49 176 26419814: Yes please secondly there should be fix timingfor classes I really missed classes because of changing time . We have to cater time difference as well
9/25/23, 8:48 PM - +92 315 3956321: Some days alternative class is possible but not on regular basis 
We know sir Qasim is busy but try take classes on Sat Sunday
9/25/23, 8:49 PM - +92 332 2928615: For the next course, as discussed, you guys decide which tradeoff to take.

9/25/23, 8:50 PM - +92 332 2928615: Will be decided later, nothing is fixed

9/25/23, 8:55 PM - +92 301 4656137: Sir Qasim @923152968211  is my choice
9/25/23, 8:55 PM - +92 301 4656137: For next course
9/25/23, 8:57 PM - +92 321 2444660: I think @923322928615  sir @923152968211 confirmed online Sat-Sun
9/25/23, 8:58 PM - +92 321 2444660: That is what majority suggested
9/25/23, 9:03 PM - +92 341 2549838: Yes
9/25/23, 9:04 PM - Azim NED PGD: Do it poll for Sir Qasim
9/25/23, 9:07 PM - +92 322 2218282: @923152968211 agar onsite classes nai lesaktay weekend pe to Kisi ko online class lainay main problem nai huni chahyay q k hamain sir qasim chahyay.
9/25/23, 9:07 PM - +92 347 2058120: Online classes me google class pe kuch smjh nai ata
9/25/23, 9:08 PM - +92 341 2549838: Already did
9/25/23, 9:08 PM - +92 344 2893351: Onsite class better option
9/25/23, 9:08 PM - +92 345 8205010: I think Sir Qasim is a very good teacher. May be most of us want to study Data Visualization with him. I also like his calm teaching style.

*BUT*

The question, is it possible for most people to take classes other than Sat/Sun ?

Many of us are professionals, many work in USA & EU time zones .. it is simply not possible for everyone to take classes on weekdays. <This message was edited>
9/25/23, 9:08 PM - +92 341 2549838: Depend karya teacher kon
9/25/23, 9:10 PM - +92 322 2218282: Main onsite ki student hun lekin online classes b li Hain Maine Kuch samjh na ayai to 10 dafa sawaal puchainhain @923152968211 se aur concept clear huay Hain so it's not big deal
9/25/23, 9:10 PM - +92 334 3742954: Agreed we haven't tried any other teacher yet. My vote will be with sir qasim but his availability will surely be a question mark given his assignment with govt
9/25/23, 9:11 PM - +92 315 2678929: Exactly please consider weekends only.
9/25/23, 9:11 PM - +92 347 2058120: Hangup problems bht hain
9/25/23, 9:12 PM - +92 344 2893351: But most of them onsite also working on week days.
9/25/23, 9:13 PM - +92 315 2678929: Location really matters
9/25/23, 9:14 PM - +92 300 0770426: Yes only weekends and onsite classes. 
Both were the main reasons for joining that course
9/25/23, 9:14 PM - +92 315 2678929: It’s better to keep what was given before that classes would be on sat/sun.
9/25/23, 9:14 PM - +92 345 8205010: Also, there is no point of keep discussing this issue on and on.

The poll results are very clear what most of the students want. <This message was edited>

9/25/23, 9:17 PM - +92 345 8205010: These 46 students who insist for sat/sun classes, also like Sir Qasim. I also like him.

But these 46  are helpless because of their schedule or work hours. This is easy to understand.
9/25/23, 9:21 PM - +92 315 8956255: Weekend only please
9/25/23, 9:25 PM - +92 315 8956255: 😔 First think about your study friend please

9/25/23, 9:58 PM - +92 305 3075434: Highbird is a better idea, on Saturday and Sunday we can't manage other days
9/25/23, 10:09 PM - +92 301 4656137: @923322928615 What about Online Students from Different countries and cities?
9/25/23, 10:24 PM - +92 332 2928615: Same class will also be online
9/25/23, 10:24 PM - +92 332 2928615: I think leave the matter to Dr Najeed and sir qasim
9/25/23, 10:24 PM - +92 332 2928615: They will solve tour problems
9/25/23, 10:24 PM - +92 314 2767501: But we are comfortable with sir Qasim if any other instructor can't deliver us as sir Qasim did so what will happen?
9/25/23, 10:24 PM - +92 300 8253171: @923322928615 , online classes  for out of country or city  students .

9/25/23, 10:27 PM - +92 314 2767501: Baqi in the end Dr Najeed hi decide krengy I think so
9/25/23, 10:29 PM - +92 315 8956255: Listen friend. I am also teacher. As my opinion Teacher Jo bhi ho but student KO bhi effort karny pardry he. But time schedule And time punctuality is most important for us. Because we all are not only student. Even we are doing job and have more responsibility.

9/25/23, 11:03 PM - +92 347 2058120: Contact to HEC first

9/25/23, 11:03 PM - +92 345 8205010: No need to contact HEC 😉

It is understood HEC doesn't approve only online study within Pakistan
9/25/23, 11:04 PM - +92 345 8205010: That's why NED Academy arranges physical classes
9/25/23, 11:04 PM - +92 347 2058120: Insano se kbhi kbhi ghaltyan hojati hain

9/25/23, 11:08 PM - Azim NED PGD: Who want a session today for beautiful soup discussion group will start 11:30
9/25/23, 11:09 PM - +92 345 8205010: When we decided to take admission in this PGD DSAI, we did not know who is going to be our teacher. We only wanted to study on Saturday/Sunday, physically.
9/25/23, 11:11 PM - Azim NED PGD: Yes you are right, let the management decide
9/25/23, 11:12 PM - Azim NED PGD: end "Tafreeh", now study time🤪

9/25/23, 11:15 PM - Azim NED PGD: On Thursday onsite simple, both requirements fullfil
9/25/23, 11:15 PM - +92 333 3138995: Agreed as he is only have Thursday available majority of us here are professional because of the job routine only weekends is viable for us.

So if there is any other teacher who has an strong will and has a professional curriculum i guess then we r good to go.
9/25/23, 11:16 PM - +92 345 8205010: Not simple, dear friend 😊

Most of the students can't attend thursday calss physically .. and rest may can't attend online due to their office hours
9/25/23, 11:16 PM - +92 333 3138995: It's better to change the teacher then we get the variety along with that experiences too
9/25/23, 11:16 PM - +92 333 3138995: True agreed

9/25/23, 11:21 PM - +92 333 2318028: Why you guys are debating, it is the duty of NED to provide best teachers with available designated time for professional, ultimate we all are professional and job is our primary need and learning is secondary so let the NED management to decide the best for us...
9/25/23, 11:21 PM - +92 347 2058120: Good

10/9/23, 11:33 AM - +92 334 3742954: Sir, if we can do data visualization on power BI. Why do we use python for same ?
10/9/23, 11:35 AM - +92 321 3551490: Dear as I mentioned yesterday, Python is preferred for data visualization when you need unparalleled customization, advanced analytics, and the ability to create highly specialized and complex visualizations that go beyond the capabilities of Power BI's user-friendly interface.
10/9/23, 11:36 AM - +92 334 3742954: Ahan - so in simple words python can do more than what power BI is capable of
10/9/23, 11:37 AM - +92 321 3551490: Yes, Python can offer more advanced and highly customizable data visualization options than Power BI.
10/9/23, 11:39 AM - +92 321 3551490: but nonetheless, Power BI is most popular tool among non coders
10/9/23, 11:41 AM - +92 334 3742954: Thanks for the clarity. Appreciated

10/11/23, 3:18 PM - +92 300 0770426: I would suggest you to learn these topics from internet instead of waiting for the class and wasting your time. YouTube aur Google per aapko sara material mil jaye ga. Jo samajh main na aaye who sir se class main discuss kerlain

10/11/23, 3:25 PM - +49 176 26419814: Those who are taking physical class should highlight this issue infront of management.
10/11/23, 3:25 PM - +92 347 2058120: Management made this group for discussion
10/11/23, 3:26 PM - +92 314 2758250: @923002171407
10/11/23, 3:29 PM - +92 341 2549838: @923002171407 you kind attention will be required

10/11/23, 3:38 PM - +92 300 0770426: Mera mashwara sub ki bhalaee k liye tha. koi argument nahi tha. agar aapko group pe request kerte rehna pasand hai tau yah aapki apni marzi hai. Har teacher apne course outline k hisaab se parhata hai aur usi hisaab se apna schedule set kerta hai. Yah topic jis teacher ko cover kerwanay chahiyah thay unhon ne nahi kerwaye. Aur waise bhi 1st semester main bhi sara course apne madad aap pe hi cover hua hai. Us waqt sub Khushi Khushi project bhi ker rahay thay. Ab online material dhoondhne main problem ho rahi hai
10/11/23, 3:44 PM - +92 314 2767501: Bro apki bt apni jaga Sahi hai apky pass time hoga extra searching ka videos dekhny ka Mera project chal rha hai subah 7 bjy sy rt 10 tk Kam hota hai aese hi bht sy hongy barri mushkil sy Mai Hyderabad sy Karachi ata hn Friday night classes attend krny

In First semester, we learn and get confidence how to code etc.... , i am new in this filed background from finance
10/11/23, 3:47 PM - +92 347 2058120: Bhai hum management se request to karskte hain na
10/11/23, 3:49 PM - +92 333 3138995: Bhai mentorship alag huti, self learning alag huti hai, aur ap jb field mai jao gay yeh libraries important hai, atleast humy yeh pata huna chaiye k kb aur kaha kasey use hu rai hai Industries mai, agar hum class ya numbers k liye class mai hi sirf aye tu pirr NED join karney ka kia faida, *JDC* Free mai seekha raha hai waha chaley jatey hai.
10/11/23, 3:51 PM - +92 300 0770426: I can understand yaar. That's why I am saying k we shouldn't be dependent on someone. Extra class k liye bhi tau time nikaalna paray ga. Behter hoga apne busy time se thora thora time nikaal ker in topics ko online cover karain aur jahan kuch samajh na aaye wahan sir ki assistance lelain class main hi.
10/11/23, 3:52 PM - +92 315 8956255: @923002171407 . kindly sir arrange our class
10/11/23, 3:52 PM - +92 315 8956255: For pandas and numpy. @923002171407
10/11/23, 3:54 PM - +92 333 3138995: Yrr industry ka use case kia hai and if we are studying here in Pakistan,  yaha ki market ka work ethics ka sir hi bata saktey hai, hum youtube sy jitna seekhley still need guidance and mentorship. Wo kaha sy laye. 

And i am sorry agar apko problem hai time ka ya jo bhi hai it's your concern, many of the students are demanding it so i guess sir should go woth the majority.
10/11/23, 3:54 PM - +92 347 2058120: Mere piyare bhai hum request karahe hain na sir se class lene pandas or numpy agr apko nai leni hoto mat lena ap online karlena apko Jaise smjh aye Waise karlena but hamen request karne den shukrya
10/11/23, 3:56 PM - +92 300 0770426: Bhai aapne tau 2nd Semester bhi sir Qasim k liye request ki thi.

10/11/23, 3:57 PM - Azim NED PGD: It's ok yar, Tum na Lina in case of extra class simple, don't aurgement here against class
10/11/23, 4:00 PM - Azim NED PGD: Dear we are all together, project mai ek dusry ki help ki then why negative aurgement, If you don't want leave it, it's request basically help to each other for learning pandas and numpy, Tum ko lagta hy kesi ko nai pata ky internet per available hy ya nai, sb ko pata hy
10/11/23, 4:08 PM - +92 333 3786116: There is no point in discussing or arguing here in the group, better to talk directly with the management before/ after the class.

If we all keep sending msgs/ discussing, there are chances that request for pandas and numpy may overlooked.

This topics must have been covered by Sir Qasim and at that time no one asked to Sir Qasim.
10/11/23, 4:18 PM - +92 332 2928615: If topics were missed you should have informed Sir Qasim he would have covered
But now that they have not been covered I can take a online class or physical one on the weekend to cover the main concepts
10/11/23, 4:21 PM - Azim NED PGD: Jazakallaha Jamal bhai

10/13/23, 11:19 AM - +92 347 2058120: @923213551490 sir agr hum date wise month wise year wise define karne chahen to kaise karenge jo Mera pass data hai usme sirf date wise hai defined hai
10/13/23, 11:20 AM - Azim NED PGD: use filter
10/13/23, 11:21 AM - Azim NED PGD: Just add new column with Month, Day and then use filter or groupby function up to you as per requirement
10/13/23, 11:22 AM - +92 347 2058120: Data sheet me add karna hoga
10/13/23, 11:23 AM - Azim NED PGD: dataset mai
10/13/23, 11:24 AM - +92 347 2058120: Means that ke matplotlib sirf visual karwata hai jo bhi backend pe data hoga
10/13/23, 11:24 AM - +92 347 2058120: Ya hum direct monthwise read nai karwaskte
10/13/23, 11:24 AM - Azim NED PGD: yes, its mean you have strong grip on  pandas and numpy
10/13/23, 11:26 AM - Azim NED PGD: you need to set data as per your requirement, means different data sets can be build then go for matplotlib
10/13/23, 11:26 AM - +92 347 2058120: Ok
10/13/23, 11:27 AM - +92 347 2058120: But I think aisa bhi hota hoga ke date ki jaga hum us column ko month ya year se read karwain
10/13/23, 11:28 AM - Azim NED PGD: its can be possible, i think sir will tell you better
10/13/23, 11:41 AM - +92 321 3551490: Yes, you can do. For this, you have to have a strong grip on Dates and Times in Python
10/13/23, 11:42 AM - +92 347 2058120: Ok sir
10/13/23, 11:44 AM - +92 347 2058120: I just come to know that is ki bht zarorat hai
10/13/23, 3:07 PM - +92 345 8205010: Once the data is stored in dataframe, one can do anything with the data without interfering or changing the original data in the excel/csv file.

We can manipulate dataframe as per our requirements. Add new columns, make new dataframes, lists, dicttionaries, etc.
10/13/23, 3:28 PM - +92 347 2058120: For only the visualisation is correct other wise you can also manipulate the data and data frame and list with python code as well so you just extract the data with same data fram and got result by editing the data set and data from python

10/13/23, 6:21 PM - +92 347 2058120: That’s why I m not a topper
10/13/23, 6:35 PM - +92 315 8956255: R u kidding ?
10/13/23, 7:01 PM - +92 345 8205010: Fully knowing the fact that the previous two comments were pretty much on lighter note, here are my two cents:

I would suggest to all (including myself) - let's not be in a race of getting higher grades.

I'll be happy & contented, if I'd just get passing marks. If i would be able to translate even 50% of this learning in my professional work, that will be success for me.

I'm here only to learn, not to break any benchmark.

10/16/23, 11:00 AM - +92 333 3786116: After that 1 pm to 3 pm regular class?
10/16/23, 11:01 AM - +92 333 3786116: 4 hours continuous class can make us tired. I would suggest to keep it on Friday evening as we have other things scheduled on the weekend.
10/16/23, 11:02 AM - +92 315 8956255: Yes.
10/16/23, 11:04 AM - +92 333 3049058: saturday class 12:30 start hoti hai hamari
10/16/23, 11:05 AM - +49 176 26419814: Right
10/16/23, 11:05 AM - +92 332 2928615: I am not free on friday evening, busy till 9 30 pm
10/16/23, 11:06 AM - Azim NED PGD: Friday night at 10 pm ?

10/16/23, 11:09 AM - +49 176 26419814: Then we can plan in a way that we have some break in between both classes 4 hour at once will be too much.
10/16/23, 11:10 AM - +92 331 2311120: Best is we do pandas this week and start with Regular classes next week maybe? This can help us better.
10/16/23, 11:12 AM - Azim NED PGD: We all should come at one point, and must have to compromise their other activities for the sake of pandas and numpy, what ever the time , I am available anytime and any place,
10/16/23, 11:14 AM - +92 331 2311120: If we do pandas this week and then start visualisation, this will help us better understanding methods. Even if we are to complete this course one or two weeks after, won’t be a big deal. Precision > Hurrying
10/16/23, 11:14 AM - +92 314 2767501: @923322928615 Jamal bhai 11 to 12:30 best hai Saturday ko onsite

10/16/23, 11:20 AM - +92 332 2928615: Not possible

10/16/23, 1:04 PM - +92 321 3551490: this kind of issues are dealt with regular python
10/16/23, 1:04 PM - +92 321 3551490: however
10/16/23, 1:05 PM - +92 321 3551490: you need to know how to drop rows in pandas and how to rename column name
10/16/23, 1:05 PM - +92 321 3551490: so inshort first delete rows using df.drop method
10/16/23, 1:06 PM - +92 321 3551490: and then use df.rename method
10/16/23, 1:14 PM - +92 300 0770426: Ok. Thanks for your prompt response sir.
10/16/23, 1:19 PM - +92 300 0770426: I am trying. will ask for your guidance if needed
10/16/23, 1:34 PM - +92 321 3551490: You are most welcome
10/16/23, 2:03 PM - Azim NED PGD: @923213551490 Assalam Walikum Sir, I get some warning for append two table using pandas "the frame.append method is dprecated and will be remove from pandas in a future version. Use pandas.concat instead of frame.append" concat append the dataframe ?
10/16/23, 2:04 PM - Azim NED PGD: <Media omitted>
10/16/23, 2:07 PM - +92 300 8253171: It's just a warning error, depending on the version we use.
10/16/23, 2:28 PM - +92 321 3551490: its a future warning. just ignore it. However soon append method will be removed with pandas.
10/16/23, 2:29 PM - +92 321 3551490: However concat method is more appropriate as it provides merging on both axis
10/16/23, 2:30 PM - Azim NED PGD: Jazakallaha
10/16/23, 2:34 PM - +92 321 3551490: Barak Allah
